# Powertool
Powertool is:
- A toolkit for building scripts
- A way to run and install scripts
- A tool for installing templates

These "scripts" can be any rolled up js file and can be installed from any Github repo, and these "templates" can be any Github repository marked as such.

We're still building the early tools, but stay tuned for more to come!
