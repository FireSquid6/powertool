# Powertool

This is the actual application for powertool! It's split into multiple modules:

- core - handles the core functionality of powertool
- cli - handles the `pwrtool` command
- exec - handles the `ptx` command
- action - handles the github action for powertool (coming soon!)
- docker - handles the docker image for powertool (coming soon!)

If you're looking for the tools to build a kit, you'll need to look in other repos. See the docs for more information.
