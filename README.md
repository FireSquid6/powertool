# Powertool
Powertool is:
- A toolkit for building scripts
- A way to run and install scripts
- A tool for installing templates

These "scripts" can be any rolled up js file and can be installed from any Github repo, and these "templates" can be any Github repository marked as such.

We're still building the early tools, but stay tuned for more to come!

# Install
Powertool can be installed with npm:
```
npm install -g powertool
```
You can then run

# Post-Install
I'd recommend installing the tool templates kit:
```
pwrtl install pwrtool/tool-templates
```

You can then create your own kits with:
```
pwrtl run pwrtool/tool-templates tool-node
```
